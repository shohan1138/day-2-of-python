# Day 2 of Python

This repository contains Python scripts created on the second day of learning Python. The files demonstrate basic programming concepts such as arithmetic operations, input handling, and simple calculators.

## Files Description

### `39=12.py`
A playful script likely exploring unexpected or humorous outputs in Python. (Please clarify its purpose if you'd like a more accurate description.)

### `BMI_Calculator.py`
Calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input for height and weight. Demonstrates arithmetic operations and user input handling.

### `Tip_calcilator.py`
A simple tip calculator that helps users split bills and calculate tips. Useful for practicing float operations and input/output formatting.

### `days_to_live_untill_90.py`
Estimates how many days, weeks, and months a person has left until age 90 based on their current age. Great for practicing math and time calculations.

### `len.py`
Demonstrates the use of the `len()` function to calculate the length of a string.

### `len_exp.py`
An extended example of using `len()`—possibly with more complex input or multiple variables.

### `pemdas.py`
Explores the order of operations in Python using PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction).

### `39=12.PNG` & `how many days in weeks to live untill 90 years.PNG`
Screenshots related to the scripts above, possibly showing outputs or explanations.
